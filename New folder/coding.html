        <h2>My Second Favorite Hobby</h2>
        <p>Since Grade 11 has started and we started to do coding in media design, I fell in love with coding, coding is
            just so much fun in my opnion because I have always liked starting things and creating things from 0 just
            like blender, in blender you start with a square and you can turn that into things like a realist donut, am
            really excited for
            second semester and do more coding in computer programming class, I also join the Coding School Club because
            I really enjoy coding right now and I
            think ill do it in my free time after we are done with it for this semester. </p>
