        <h2>My favorite Hobby/Sport</h2>
        <p>My favorite Sport and Hobby is badminton because in my opnion is not like most sports and mainly because am
            short to play sports like volley ball or basketball, I started playing badminton about a year ago with
            Kristan and it was so fun going to morning practices at 6 and playing badminton until 8 after school
            friday's,
            everytime I played it I had a lot fun and I also made it to the badminton team and met new people that are
            really cool and helped me get better at badminton, I still play badminton and I planned to get better and
            join the Senior School Team with Kristan.</p>
