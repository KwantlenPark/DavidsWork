        <h2>My favorite Anime</h2>
        <p>Watching Anime is one of my favorite things to do, but my favorite one has to go to Black Clover, i am not
            really a anime watcher but watching Black Clover is what really got me into anime because the story and the
            characters in Black Clover were so well writing that I really enjoy the anime and I wish I could Watch it
            again with out knowing what happens. </p>
